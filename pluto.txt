pluto is not a planet anymore
:(

What is it then?
Still no idea about what pluto is.
 Carmen theory is that it is a planet again
There seems to be a 2018 paper that states pluto is a dwarf planet
Not sure about the reference - it's complicated to find these things
We decided to keep this discussion on a non-scientific niveau and rather update on rumours.
